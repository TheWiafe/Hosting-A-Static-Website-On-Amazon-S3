## Overview

Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to store unlimited amounts of data, from anywhere in the world on the web!

Also, a static website is a type of website with a fixed number of pre-built files stored on a web server. These files are written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user requests a page on a static website, the server simply retrieves the pre-built HTML file and sends it back to the user’s browser without any server-side processing.

The content is “static” — hence the only way to change how the website looks is by manually changing the content of the files.

In order to host a static website on Amazon S3, we have to go through four (4) major steps. These steps are highlighted below

1. Creating a bucket in Amazon S3.
2. Configuring a static website on Amazon S3.
3. Uploading content to your bucket.
4. Turning on public access to the objects.
